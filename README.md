# project Euler
Written programs to solve project euler problems in various languages

Each problem will have its own branch to work on. This is just so I can happily
keep things separated.

The Master branch (this one) will contain the master readme and also some basic
info.

Note that unit tests may or may not be present depending on how easy it is to
implement in the language or how hard the problem is. E.g. I probably wont write
unit tests for C code unless the problem is really hard and really demands it
for insurance.
